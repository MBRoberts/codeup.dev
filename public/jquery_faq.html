		<h1>National Parks</h1>
		
		<h3>Badlands National Park</h3>
		
		<ul>

			<li>The park contains numerous examples of native wildlife, notably the American bison, which grazes on the plains, and smaller animals, such as the badger and black-tailed prairie dog. Most notably, since 1994 the park has served as the site for the reintroduction of the black-footed ferret, one of the most endangered animals in the world, which depends upon the park’s protected status to thrive.</li>

			

			<li>The hills and buttes in Badlands National Park consist largely of sedimentary rock. Because they have eroded in such dramatic formations, it’s easy to detect the geological history of the area through the different-colored layers of rock visible in the hillside. The rock in the park is eroding at a rate of 1 inch per year; branches of the Cheyenne, White, and Bad rivers contribute greatly to the erosion.</li>

			

			<li>In 1890, Badlands National Park witnessed one of the last "ghost dances" at Stronghold Table. The Lakota Indians believed that the dance rendered them impervious to bullets and that it would push the encroaching white men out of their territory. The area retains deep significance to the Lakota Indians and the Oglala Lakota tribe administers the Stronghold Table site with the National Park Service.</li>

			

			<li>During World War II, the US government took over a portion of the Pine Ridge Reservation for use as a gunnery range. That area now falls within the purveyance of the park, in the Stronghold District. From 1942 until 1945, the military tested new forms of artillery there. After the war, the South Dakota National Guard used it as an artillery range. The Air Force declared the range excess property in 1968, and while the military retains 2,500 acres, it is no longer used.</li>

		</ul>



		<h3>Arches National Park</h3>
		
		<ul>

			<li>There are more than 2,000 arches in the park; to be classified as an arch, the opening must measure at least three feet across. The largest arch in the park, Landscape Arch, spans 306 feet (longer than a football field) base to base. New arches are constantly forming, while old ones occasionally collapse—most recently Wall Arch, which fell in 2008.</li>
			
			<li>Arches National Park contains ephemeral pools, from a few inches to several feet in depth, that are essentially mini-ecosystems, home to tadpoles, fairy shrimp, and insects. The pools form among the sandstone basins, within potholes that collect the rare rainwater and sediment.</li>
			
			<li>About 300 million years ago an inland sea covered what is now Arches National Park. The sea evaporated and re-formed more than 29 times, leaving behind salt beds thousands of feet thick</li>
			
			<li>Another unique aspect of the park is its knobby black ground cover, which is actually alive. A biological soil crust, it is composed of algae, lichens, and cyanobacteria (one of Earth’s earliest life forms), and provides a secure foundation for the desert plants.</li>
		</ul>


		<h3>Carlsbad Caverns National Park</h3>

		<ul>

			<li>The Guadalupe Mountains were formed around 20 million years ago when tectonic activity forced a gigantic limestone reef to rise from an inland sea. Over time, sulfuric acid ate away at the rocks, creating caves and underground passageways. Later, rainwater trickled into the caverns, leaving mineral deposits on the walls, floors and ceilings. These deposits eventually built up into rock formations such as stalactites and stalagmites.</li>
			
			<li>Although Indian settlers almost certainly discovered the caverns, local cowboy Jim White is credited with exploring them. He first descended underground as a teenager in 1898, using a home-made wire ladder, but it was over 10 years before he could interest anyone else in his discovery. Early visitors descended to the caves via an old mining bucket. In 1923, President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed Carlsbad Caverns a National Monument and, in 1930, the Carlsbad Caverns National Park was established.</li>
			
			<li>Carlsbad Caverns National Park contains a section of an ancient fossil reef from the Permian age, and also includes one of the only protected areas of the Chihuahuan Desert eco-system. Although the park has no official campground, backcountry camping is allowed with a permit from the Visitor Center. Other activities in the park include hiking, wildlife-watching and stargazing.</li>
			
			<li>Big Cave is the biggest cavern, measuring approximately 3,800 feet long by 600 feet wide. It boasts some of the largest and most colorful rock formations, which are illuminated by white lights. Lower Cave also contains remarkable formations, and Left Hand Tunnel is renowned for its cave pools and fossils. The King's Palace is a series of four chambers, located in the deepest accessible area of the caverns, which contain unusual rippled rock formations known as the Queen's Draperies. The Hall of the White Giant is a remote cavern famous for its huge white stalagmite. All of these caves can be visited via a guided or self-guided tour.</li>
